# dftb_lattice_opt_tool
A useful small script for batch jobs of lattice optimization on DFTB+ (https://dftbplus.org/). 
The angular momentum has been predefined and could be edited.
It generate heirachical directories with assigned lattice parameters based on given footstep. The input .hsd file will also be generated.
